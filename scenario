The thing I need is to automate Tinder on my Android phone, this involves enabling flight mode
waiting 2-3 seconds and disabling it again, creating a Facebook account, phone verifying it
(which involves inputting a phone number from notepad on the phone and visiting a website to
get the verification code). Once the facebook account is created (with a specific name but no
profile picture), the phone needs to then update the GPS location to a specific location, then
open up tinder, press login with facebook, accept the prompt to allow permission and enter the
(same) phone number again, edit the tinder profile (add profile pictures, fill out the bio, pick
a random song as an anthem), update the options in tinder to decrease the search radius and
increase the age range. Exit the app (and if using the gps location faker app, disable it) and
re open tinder back up, then exit and re enter the app until people appear (this is necessary to
force tinder to update to the gps location previously faked), then like 100 people and logout.
Without exiting the app, pressing log in with phone number, enter the (still same) phone number,
 go through the registration process and once done, update the GPS location to a new location,
 edit the profile, update tinder options to decrease search radius and increase age range, then
 disable gps faker, exit tinder, open it up again (until location is updated sucessfully), like
 100 people, logout, log out of facebook. And then start the whole process over again.
